<h1 align="center">Sugar SQL</h1>

### SuQL
SuQL stands for Sugar SQL and this is just a query builder... 

### Requirements
The minimum requirement - PHP 5.6. 

### Examples
More examples in the ```tests``` directory

## Tests
`./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`

## Conclusion
SuQL is all about modifiers. They already replace standart SQL clauses such as `WHERE`, `GROUP`, `JOIN`, `ORDER` and SQL functions etc.
More than that, you can develop your own modifiers.
